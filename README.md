# ChessEngine <div> [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/) </div>
ChessEngine made with Pygame library mainly by following a step-by-step YouTube tutorial by Eddie Sharick, sometimes coming up with some improvements on my own.
I highly encourage you to visit his YouTube channel and check the whole series by yourself.
